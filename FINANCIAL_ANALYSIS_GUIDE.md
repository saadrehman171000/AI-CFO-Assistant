Create or update your `.env.local` file:

```env
# Backend API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:8000

# Other existing configuration...
DATABASE_URL="your_database_url"
CLERK_SECRET_KEY="your_clerk_key"
# ... etc
```

### 2. Backend Requirements

Your backend should provide the `/upload-financial-document` endpoint that:

- Accepts `multipart/form-data` with a `file` field
- Supports Excel (.xlsx), CSV, and PDF files
- Returns the comprehensive financial analysis JSON structure

### 3. API Response Structure

The backend should return data in the following structure:

```typescript
{
  file_info: {
    filename: string
    file_type: string
    file_size_mb: number
  },
  analysis: {
    profit_and_loss: { /* P&L metrics */ },
    balance_sheet: { /* Balance sheet data */ },
    cash_flow_statement: { /* Cash flow data */ },
    financial_ratios: { /* All financial ratios */ },
    ai_powered_insights: {
      trend_analysis: Array<{ /* trend data */ }>,
      anomaly_detection: Array<{ /* anomaly data */ }>,
      predictive_alerts: Array<{ /* alert data */ }>
    },
    executive_summary: {
      business_health_score: number,
      financial_strength: string,
      critical_alerts: string[]
    },
    strategic_recommendations: { /* recommendations */ },

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Issues**

   - Verify `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` is set correctly
   - Ensure your backend is running on the specified port
   - Check CORS configuration if running on different domains
